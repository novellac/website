## The Idea

Want to stay in sync with your study group? Create an app that lets you do a shared Pomodoro-style timer. The app must do a few things:

* Create start, pause, and end buttons
* Emit a noise at the end of the timer
* Show a decreasing amount of time
* Create a randomized link for each new timer instance
* Anyone with the link can see the timer
* Anyone with the link can control (start/pause/end) the timer

## Additional Features

* Allow the user to toggle between decreasing and increasing time views
* Make the favicon change with the amount of time left
* Make the app's title be the time left, so you can see the time decrease
* Make break times variable
* Set permissions so that only the person who started the timer can control it
* Allow the person who started the timer to select other users to also be able to control the timer
* Create calendar invites - the calendar invite description would contain a link to a Pomoduo instance
* Allow users to create accounts
* Allow logged-in users to create groups, so they can easily send invites to multiple people
* Add an invite form, so that users can send the link to a list of email addresses
* Allow users to create customized links to their shared timer
