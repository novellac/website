## The Idea

Want to stay in sync with your study group? Create an app that lets you do a shared Pomodoro-style timer. When you create a new instance, you would be given a randomized link. Anyone with the link can see the ou'd get a random link.Like you'd get a random link (or customizable if you pay maybe?), and then anyone with the link can see and control the timer. Maybe if there are accounts, then you can see who has joined the timer.

## Additional Features

* Set permissions so that only the person who started the timer can control it
* Allow the person who started the timer to select other users to also be able to control the timer
* Create calendar invites - the calendar invite would contain a link to a Pomoduo instance
* Allow users to create accounts
* Allow logged-in users to create groups, so they can easily send invites to multiple people
* Add an invite form, so that users can send the link to a list of email addresses
