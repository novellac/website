## The Idea

"Soup" up your ToDo list by making it into a restaurant order form!

This project would start off with a static menu of items you can click. When you click an item, it's copied onto an order. When you click a menu item multiple times, it increments the number of items on the order.

## Extra Features

* The ability to drag and drop to arrange the items in your order.
* A "customize" button to add a note to the item you've selected.
