## The Idea

This one is a bit like the Google Chrome dinosaur game, or PAC-man, but to earn points the user must learn about you!

The character must do a few things:

* Run across a 2-d scene (this is how you play)
* Jump over objects (this is how you avoid dying)
* Jump and touch little clouds with facts about your, the developer (this is how you collect points)

At the end of the game, the user sees:

* Game over message
* Score
* Your full resume
* Replay option
* A way to contact you

## Extra Features

* The longer the fact about you, the easier it is for the character to jump and touch, the fewer points they get.
* At the end of the game, the user can see which facts about you they've collected - this might encourage them to play the game again to collect all the facts.
